## Overview
Developers extract methods aiming to make the code easier to read, understand, and reuse. Aiming to measure an impact, previous studies have investigated the use of method extraction through static code metrics but some of them could not find differences. Code metrics might not capture more subtle aspects such as one’s ability to read and understand the code. Therefore, we need to complement the analysis of code metrics using a more dynamic approach that involves reading and understanding the code. We evaluate the impact of the Extract and Inline Method on code comprehension using an eye tracking camera. We conduct a controlled experiment with 32 novices in Java. Each subject solves eight simple tasks comprising four programs with the method inlined and four with the method extracted. We compare them by measuring the time, number of attempts, and visual effort with fixation duration, fixations count, and regressions count. In addition, we conduct a survey with other 58 novices on their preferences for the Inline and Extract Method. In our results, even for simple code tasks, we found differences in visual effort and understanding. For two tasks, with the extracted method, there were reductions reaching 78.8% in the time, and 84.6% in the number of regressions. On the other hand, we found increases for three tasks reaching 166.9% in the time, and in the regressions count reaching 200%. Contrasting with the survey results, we found a discrepancy between objective performance and subjective perception. When choosing to inline code, the novices were motivated by enhanced readability, the elimination of unnecessary methods, as well as the ease of coding, simplicity, and the use of meaningful names. These results raise the awareness of educators about the method extraction and its potential to ease or hinder the code comprehension for novices in Java. For researchers, these results show the potential of visual metrics to reveal an impact of refactorings that cannot be captured by static code metrics.
